# Meeting 2 Minutes
- Team members each made a progress report:
  - Sam has containerised the postgres database
  - Hannah has made a basic UI in QT
  - Mathias has created the marker class, and has made the team aware of how to interface with it
  - Hugh implemented methods to display graph from individual marker class
- Revised UI design (minor changes on buttons)
- Decision was made, to instead of having each team member run their own copy of the database, to deploy it to a development server. Accessing the database over the web will be more convenient and more simmilar to real-world deployment.
- Graphs implementation was revised - instead of 4 graphs (to deliniate between all and exemplary), there will be 1 graph which will display all of the data. We felt this would make for a more seamless user experience.
- The need for branch protection was raised.
